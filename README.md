# 3D-Reconstruction
### Application using NaRPA - a ray-tracing based image rendering engine
Navigation and Rendering Pipeline for Astronautics (NaRPA) ray tracing engine. 

Estimation of 3D points on a terrain using synthetic images generated via NaRPA - the graphics rendering tool. 
The rendered sample images are available in the [images](/images) directory. Respective ground truth data is extracted from [point cloud maps](/3D_data) rendered from NaRPA.

## Note: 

This project is only aimed at demonstration and validation of stereo reconstruction / structure from motion (SfM) idea. 
This is a very sparse 2D to 3D correspondence and not full 3D reconstruction. However, the same principle can be deployed for dense 3D reconstruction.
